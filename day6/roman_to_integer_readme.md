# Roman to Integer - README

## üìÖ Problem Statement

Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an **integer**.

Roman numerals are composed using the following symbols:

| Symbol | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| M      | 1000  |
| D      | 500   |
| C      | 100   |
| L      | 50    |
| X      | 10    |
| V      | 5     |
| I      | 1     |

### Rules:

- Symbols are placed in order of value, starting with the largest values.
- **Subtractive notation** is used for values like 4, 9, 40, 90, etc.:
  - IV = 4, IX = 9
  - XL = 40, XC = 90
  - CD = 400, CM = 900
- When a smaller value precedes a larger one, it is subtracted from the larger.
- When a larger or equal value precedes a smaller one, it is added.

## üîç Examples

### Example 1:

```text
Input: s = "III"
Output: 3
Explanation: I + I + I = 3
```

### Example 2:

```text
Input: s = "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L (50) + V (5) + III (3) = 58
```

### Example 3:

```text
Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation:
  - M = 1000
  - CM = 900
  - XC = 90
  - IV = 4
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 15`
- `s` contains only the characters: 'I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M'
- It is guaranteed that `s` is a valid Roman numeral in the range `[1, 3999]`

---

## üí° Approach

We traverse the Roman numeral string **from right to left**, tracking the total and the previous value:

### Steps:

1. Use a map to convert Roman characters to integers.
2. Start from the last character and move left.
3. For each character:
   - If its value is less than the previous value, subtract it.
   - Otherwise, add it.
4. Return the total.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - constant space for the map.

## üí™ Code Implementation (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    unordered_map<char,int> roman = {
        {'I',1}, {'V',5}, {'X',10}, {'L',50},
        {'C',100}, {'D',500}, {'M',1000}
    };

    int romanToInt(string s) {
        int total = 0;
        int prev = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int curr = roman[s[i]];
            if (curr < prev) {
                total -= curr;
            } else {
                total += curr;
            }
            prev = curr;
        }
        return total;
    }
};
```
